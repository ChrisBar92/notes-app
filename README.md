This is a project called Notes App. The app is used to create notes by entering a title and content.  The created note can be edited in any way and can be deleted. The app has a loupe for filtering notes, where when you type a letter, only notes that have that letter in the title become visible. Local storage is used so that the notes are still visible when the page is refreshed. The app is responsive and can be used on both desktop and mobile devices. Below are screenshots of the desktop view and the mobile device view.
